# ECommerce App
        Sorry for my English. This is an e-commerce application with a full stack that
    I started as a home project at the request of my friend in order to raise interest
    in his small production of interior doors and understand the logic of the retail business.
    So I decided to keep it in reality and make it affordable
    for everyone who starts a new business, and with great difficulty is forced to developers
    with a limited budget.

- Display products in this category (CityLine series, Monolith series, Z series and so on)
- Show product information
- Add the item to the cart and update the total account and the number of items
- Store the list of baskets in the database for permanent storage.
